 `Aoraplex Themes Collection`__
================================

.. __: https://github.com/agoraplex/themes

This is... wait for it... a collection of themes (well, one, so far)
for pieces of the `Agoraplex Platform`__ (which, as we note there, is
a big bag of `unknown`, right now).

So far, there's `a Sphinx theme`__, based on the `Pylons Sphinx
theme`__. You can see how it looks in the `Agoraplex platform docs`__.
